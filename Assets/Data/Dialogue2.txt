Event;East-West Courtroom #1 | Date: July 26th, 2017 | Time: 2:30 pm;0;0
Judge;The trial of Cynthia Meyers is now in session.;0;M;W;3;2
Richards;The prosecution is ready, your Honor.;0;R;W;5;0
Will;The, um, defense is also ready, your Honor.;1;L;W;4;0
Judge;Hmmm...;0;M;W;3;0
Will;I-Is something wrong?;1;L;W;4;0
Judge;Quite. I'm not sure I would entrust such a case to a... first timer...;0;M;W;3;0
Judge;The matter at hand is quite serious after all.;0;M;W;3;0
Will;(Gee, thanks...);3;L;B;4;0
Judge;I was under the impression that Ms. Daniels would be defending Miss Meyers today.;0;M;W;3;0
Judge;I make no exaggeration when I say that you are one of the best attorneys of this age.;0;M;W;3;0
Daniels;You're too kind, your Honor. However,;2;M;W;6;0
Daniels;The client specifically requested that Mr. Armstrong defend her.;0;M;W;6;0
Daniels;And who am I to detest a request?;2;M;W;6;0
Judge;Fair enough, I suppose. Though this may hurt her case...;0;M;W;3;0
Richards;Oh please. Let the greenhorn defend his mistress.;1;R;W;5;0
Richards;Frankly, it only makes my job easier.;0;R;W;5;0
Will;(Grrr... Who you calling greenhorn?);1;L;B;4;0
Judge;Regardless, if Ms. Daniels is trusting of him, I will let him have his chance.;0;M;W;3;0
Judge;The prosecution will now present its case to the court.;0;M;W;3;0
Richards;With pleasure. Ahem.;1;R;W;5;0
Richards;Brian O' Sullivan, CEO of Andromeda Hospital, was found dead in his office a few days ago.;0;R;W;5;0
Richards;The autopsy report from the forensics department reveals that he died due to heart failure.;0;R;W;5;0
Daniels;The poor thing. He died too soon...;0;M;W;6;0
Richards;However, this failure was not naturally caused.;0;R;W;5;0
Richards;And the prosecution has a decisive witness to prove that this failure...;0;R;W;5;0
Richards;...was due to Ms. Meyers!;1;R;R;5;0
Will;(Wait, he has evidence, AND a witness?!!);1;L;B;4;0
Will;(Why wasn't I told about this?!!);3;L;B;4;0
Daniels;Relax, Armstrong. You're sweating up a storm...;1;M;W;6;0
Daniels;Things may look bad, but you'll get your chance.;0;M;W;6;0
Will;I hope so...;5;M;W;6;0
Judge;If I heard you correctly, Mr. Richards, you said you had a decisive witness.;1;M;W;3;0
Judge;If that's the case, then this case should be over rather quickly!;1;M;W;3;0
Judge;You may call this witness to the stand!;0;M;W;3;0
Richards;Certainly, your honor.;0;R;W;5;0
Event;;0;-1
Yuri;...;0;M;W;7;2
Richards;Witness, please state your name and occupation.;2;R;W;5;0
Yuri;Yuri Chang, ex-Doctor. I am currently unemployed.;0;M;W;7;0
Richards;Now then, Ms. Chang...;0;R;W;5;0
Richards;I would like you to testify about what you saw at 2:00pm on July 14th.;1;R;W;5;0
Will;(He's getting right to the thick of it...);1;L;B;4;0
Will;Ms. Daniels, what do I do?;5;M;W;6;0
Daniels;Just pay attention. You'll get your chance.;3;M;W;6;0
Yuri;Very well. I will testify.;1;M;W;7;0
Yuri;Testimony 1: What I Saw;0;M;R;7;-1
Yuri;I was walking in in the halls close to the main office,;2;M;G;7;3
Yuri;When all of a sudden, there was a loud crashing sound.;0;M;G;7;0
Yuri;I turned and ran towards the office where the sound originated,;1;M;G;7;0
Yuri;...and saw a woman running away. I peeked inside...;0;M;G;7;0
Yuri;Only to see that Mr. Sullivan... had been shot to death!;3;M;G;7;0
Yuri;The person who ran...it was definitely her!;0;M;G;7;0
Judge;Hmm...;0;M;W;3;-1
Judge;You claim to have seen the defendant run away?;0;M;W;3;0
Yuri;Indeed. I ran away myself to call for help.;0;M;W;7;0
Judge;I see. Mr. Armstrong.;0;M;W;3;0
Will;Y-Yes, your Honor?;1;L;W;4;0
Judge;You may now begin your cross examination.;0;M;R;3;0
Will;Cross-examination, your Honor?;4;L;W;4;0
Daniels;This is it, William. This is your chance!;3;M;W;6;1
Daniels;Somewhere in her testimony, Yuri is lying.;0;M;W;6;0
Daniels;It's up to you to find out where.;0;M;W;6;0
Will;She was lying? Her testimony is-;5;M;W;6;0
Daniels;Poorly constructed. Like a stack of building blocks.;1;M;W;6;0
Daniels;Just put out the rug from under it, and her testimony will topple.;1;M;W;6;0
Will;Ok... I guess I can try.;5;M;W;6;0
Daniels;Cross-examination is simple.;0;M;W;6;0
Daniels;Go through her testimony slowly and compare her words to the evidence in the Court Record.;0;M;W;6;0
Daniels;If something doesn't match up, present the evidence that contradicts her words!;1;M;R;6;0
Will;Alright. Sounds simple enough...;5;M;W;6;0
Will;(Don't worry Cynth. Like you said...);4;L;B;4;0
Will;(Where there's a Will, there's a way!);1;L;B;4;-1

Will;Why were you walking close to the main office?;1;L;W;4;0
Yuri;I was actually heading to the office to meet with Mr. Sullivan.;0;M;W;7;0
Yuri;His secretary had called me for lunch and told me to meet him there.;1;M;W;7;0
Will;(I guess that makes sense...);4;L;B;4;0
Richards;The defense will refrain from asking trivial questions.;2;R;W;5;0
Richards;Witness, please continue.;0;R;W;5;0

Will;A loud crashing sound?!!;4;L;W;4;0
Yuri;Yes. It was very brief, but it was certainly enough to raise concern.;0;M;W;7;0
Yuri;I couldn't make out the sound, but I was startled, nonetheless.;2;M;W;7;0

Yuri;Though I am easily startled, I am no coward.;0;M;W;7;0
Yuri;I went to see what the source of that noise was...;1;M;W;7;0

Will;How are you so sure that a woman ran away from the scene?;4;L;W;4;0
Yuri;From what I've seen in these parts, men don't wear skirts and feminine attire.;3;M;W;7;0
Yuri;Though this is a progressive era, Andromeda is not a progressive hospital.;0;M;W;7;0
Yuri;Or so I hear...;2;M;W;7;0
Will;But, it could have been someone else...;1;L;W;4;0
Richards;Objection!;0;R;W;5;0
Richards;Let me remind you of the facts, greenhorn.;2;R;W;5;0
Richards;The only two people near the main office at the time were Ms. Chang and Ms. Meyers.;3;R;W;5;0
Richards;If anyone were to escape from the scene, it would have to be her.;2;R;W;5;0
Will;(Gulp...);3;L;B;4;0
Richards;If the defense if done wasting time, you may continue with your testimony, Ms. Chang.;0;R;W;5;0
Yuri;5) Only to see that Mr. Sullivan... had been shot to death!;3;M;G;7;0

Yuri;The crashing noise would have to have been the gunshot.;1;M;W;7;0
Yuri;It's...just too difficult to remember the image...;6;M;W;7;0
Judge;Now now, Ms. Chang. It will be over soon.;0;M;W;3;0
Judge;Just bear with us and you'll be out of here in time for supper!;1;M;W;3;0
Will;(D-Don't take her side, your Honor...);3;L;B;4;0
Daniels;William. Did you notice what she just said?;0;M;W;6;0
Will;Yes. Why?;5;M;W;6;0
Daniels;Pay attention to her statement and look at the Court Record again.;0;M;W;6;0
Daniels;You may just find something!;1;M;W;6;0
Will;Alright. If you really say so...;5;M;W;6;0
Yuri;6) The person who ran...it was definitely her!;0;M;G;7;0

Will;How can you be so sure?;4;L;W;4;0
Yuri;Her clothes, her hair, it all matches!;1;M;W;7;0
Yuri;I couldn't have possibly forgotten.;3;M;W;7;0
Richards;In addition, it could not have been possible for anyone else to have left.;2;R;W;5;0
Richards;The only people who were present near his office were Ms. Chang and Ms. Meyers.;3;R;W;5;0
Richards;Ergo, only Ms. Meyers could have left the scene.;2;R;W;5;0
Will;Is Yuri really lying?;5;M;W;6;0
Daniels;Ms. Meyers is innocent, correct?;1;M;W;6;0
Daniels;Then Ms. Chang has to be lying.;0;M;W;6;0
Daniels;Unless, of course, Cynthia is really...guilty.;3;M;W;6;0
Will;Of course not!;5;M;W;6;0
Daniels;That's the spirit. Use the Court Record to find a contradiction in her words.;1;M;W;6;0
Daniels;Present the contradicting evidence in order to rip her testimony to shreds.;1;M;W;6;0
Daniels;You can do this, Armstrong.;0;M;W;6;0
Player;Restart testimony:line,75
Will;Objection!;1;L;W;4;0
Will;Your Honor, this evidence proves that the witness is lying!;2;L;W;4;0
Judge;Really? How?;2;M;W;3;0
Will;W-Well, it's...uh...quite clear that, uh...;3;L;W;4;0
Judge;...I'm afraid that this evidence does nothing for your case.;0;M;W;3;0
Judge;You will be penalized.;0;M;R;3;0
Health;3;0
Will;(This isn't good...);3;L;B;4;0
Daniels;William, stay focused. You can't afford to make mistakes...;0;M;W;6;0
Daniels;Just pay attention to her words and the Court Record.;1;M;W;6;0
Daniels;If something doesn't match up, present the evidence that contradicts her words.;0;M;R;6;0
Player;Restart Testimony:line,75
Will;Objection!;1;L;W;4;-1
Will;Ms. Chang, you claimed that Mr. Sullivan had been shot to death.;2;L;W;4;0
Will;Is that correct?;1;L;W;4;0
Yuri;Yes. He had been shot.;0;M;W;7;0
Will;If that's so, I'd have to say...;1;L;W;4;0
Will;...you're quite a bad liar!;7;L;W;4;0
Yuri;W-What?;2;M;W;7;3
Will;According to the autopsy report, the victim died due to heart failure, not a gunshot!;2;L;W;4;0
Yuri;...!;6;M;W;7;0
Will;If he had really been shot, then why wasn't it mentioned in the autopsy report?;2;L;W;4;0
Daniels;Excellent work, William! I knew you could do it!;2;M;W;6;0
Will;Thanks, Ms. Daniels.;5;M;W;6;0
Judge;Witness, please explain this discrepancy.;0;M;W;3;0
Judge;Why were you so certain that he had been shot?;1;M;W;3;0
Yuri;W-Well, I...;5;M;W;7;0
Richards;Relax, Ms. Chang. I can explain for you.;1;R;W;5;0
Will;...?;1;L;W;4;0
Richards;You see, your Honor, the official Autopsy Report only covers so much.;0;R;W;5;0
Richards;I've taken the liberty of asking the forensics team for additional information.;1;R;W;5;0
Richards;The results were highly informative.;3;R;W;5;0
Will;(Grrr... he's prepared...);3;L;B;4;0
Richards;It appears that a bullet was, in fact, found close to Mr. Sullivan's heart.;3;R;W;5;0
Richards;Who is to say that Ms. Meyers's shot wasn't the killing factor itself...;1;R;W;5;0
Richards;But rather that it was the cause of the heart failure?;1;R;W;5;0
Richards;Hence, an accurate testimony from Ms. Chang.;0;R;W;5;0
Yuri;Y-Yes. That's right! I know what I saw!;0;M;W;7;0
Will;...(H-he just took my contradiction and tossed it in the garbage!);3;L;B;4;0
Will;...(What am I supposed to do now?);3;L;B;4;0
Richards;Of course, I possess proof for this claim for your perusal.;1;R;W;5;0
Evidence;Crime Scene photo now usable;5;0
Evidence;Mr. Sullivan's Medical Chart (Page 1) now usable;5;0
Judge;Hmm... The prosecution has raised a valid point.;0;M;W;3;0
Judge;Defense. Can you explain where this bullet came from?;1;M;W;3;0
Will;Y-Yes, your Honor... If the defense may have a moment...;3;L;W;4;0
Will;Ms. Daniels... Help!;5;M;W;6;0
Daniels;Scared yet, Armstrong? You shouldn't be.;0;M;W;6;0
Daniels;Richards is trying to pull a fast one on you. Don't let him.;1;M;W;6;0
Daniels;Quickly, look at the description of the photo he just added.;0;M;W;6;0
Daniels;Read it...carefully. Anything that looks like a throwaway detail may be useful...;0;M;W;6;0
Daniels;Did you notice anything?;1;M;R;6;0
Player;His desk...:line,201;His coat...:line,205;Nothing...:line,201
Daniels;Are you sure you looked at the description thoroughly?;1;M;W;6;0
Daniels;Try again.;0;M;W;6;0
Daniels;Do you notice anything odd about the Crime Scene Photo?;0;M;R;6;0
Player;His desk...:line,201;His coat...:line,205;Nothing:line,201
Daniels;Right!;3;M;W;6;0
Daniels;If Cynthia really shot Mr. Sullivan, then there would be a point of entry...;0;M;W;6;0
Daniels;...aka, a bullet hole in his coat!;1;M;W;6;0
Judge;Well, Mr. Armstrong? Do you have an answer?;0;M;W;3;0
Will;Although the defense does not know exactly where the bullet came from...;3;L;W;4;0
Will;I can rule out the possibility of the defendant shooting the victim.;1;L;W;4;0
Richards;And how exactly do you plan to prove this, greenhorn?;0;R;W;5;0
Judge;Well spoken. What proof do you have, Mr. Armstrong?;0;M;W;3;0
Judge;Present your evidence as to how Ms. Meyers couldn't have shot the victim.;0;M;R;3;0
Player;Autopsy Report:line,215;Orange Envelope:line,215;Crime Scene Photo:line,223;Medical Report (Pg 1):line,215
Will;Look at this!;1;L;W;4;0
Judge;I don't see how this evidence proves anything.;0;M;W;3;0
Judge;Do take this seriously, Mr. Armstrong.;0;M;W;3;0
Health;3;0
Will;Sorry, your Honor. Let me try again.;1;L;W;4;0
Judge;Fine then. I'll repeat myself.;0;M;W;3;0
Judge;Present your evidence as to how Ms. Meyers couldn't have shot the victim.;0;M;R;3;0
Player;Autopsy Report:line,215;Orange Envelope:line,215;Crime Scene Photo:line,223;Medical Report (Pg 1):line,215
Will;Look at this!;1;L;W;4;-1
Will;This is a photo depicting the victim's body after it was analyzed by the police.;2;L;W;4;0
Will;Notice anything?;1;L;W;4;0
Judge;Well... no. I don't see anything peculiar here.;0;M;W;3;0
Will;Exactly. There's nothing peculiar about this photo.;7;L;W;4;0
Richards;What's your point, greenhorn?;0;R;W;5;0
Will;Well, if Ms. Meyers really shot Mr. Sullivan, there would be some sort of bullet hole in his coat...;2;L;W;4;0
Will;But, as the photo shows, there is none!;2;L;R;4;0
Will;Ergo, she couldn't have shot Mr. Sullivan!;7;L;W;4;3
Richards;Urk...;2;R;W;5;0
Judge;I see! That does rule out the possibility, doesn't it!;1;M;W;3;0
Yuri;Objection!;5;M;W;7;0
Judge;...;1;M;W;3;0
Richards;...;2;R;W;5;0
Will;Wha...;3;L;W;4;0
Yuri;D-Desist! I can explain!;5;M;W;7;0
Judge;Care to enlighten us, Ms. Chang?;1;M;W;3;0
Yuri;I-I know what I saw! I should have been more specific.;5;M;W;7;0
Yuri;I apologize, but I thought my explanation was fine the way it was.;3;M;W;7;0
Judge;If that's the case, then you may amend your testimony.;0;M;W;3;0
Judge;Please inform us as to why there is no point of entry in the victim's coat.;0;M;W;3;-1
Yuri;Testimony 2: Why There's No Bullet Hole;0;M;G;7;0
Yuri;I was close to the office when it happened, actually.;3;M;G;7;3
Yuri;She fired a shot underneath his jacket at point-blank!;6;M;G;7;0
Yuri;That's why there was no hole in his coat.;1;M;G;7;0
Yuri;BANG! And he fell to the desk.;3;M;G;7;0
Yuri;She ran away after that, and so did I, to call the police!;2;M;G;7;0
Judge;Hmmm...;0;M;W;3;-1
Judge;If the defendant fired underneath the victim's jacket...;0;M;W;3;0
Judge;...that would clear up the coat discrepancy and explain why the bullet was found in his chest.;0;M;W;3;0
Richards;Well, greenhorn? Are you not satisfied?;0;R;W;5;0
Will;Let me have my cross examination. I'll tell you after that, Richards.;1;L;W;4;0
Richards;Hmph... Fine.;3;R;W;5;0
Daniels;Armstrong, you may need a bit more information this time around.;0;M;W;6;0
Daniels;You can't prove anything at this point.;1;M;W;6;0
Daniels;If you want to get more information, you can press the witness.;0;M;W;6;0
Daniels;That way, she will be a bit more specific with her words.;0;M;W;6;0
Daniels;You may even be able to add an extra statement to the testimony.;1;M;W;6;0
Will;Alright. I'll give it a shot.;5;M;W;6;0
Will;(Press, then present. Alright, I've got this.);7;L;B;4;0
Judge;You may proceed with your cross examination.;0;M;W;3;0

Judge;Ah!;1;M;W;3;0
Yuri;Grrrr...;5;M;W;7;0
Will;Yep. This medical record accounts for the bullet in his chest!;1;L;W;4;0

Daniels;What? What do you mean?;1;M;W;6;0
Will;All the evidence is coming together...;5;M;W;6;0
Will;I think I know who killed Mr. Sullivan! All I have to do is prove it.;5;M;W;6;0
Daniels;I don't follow, but I'll help you any way I can.;1;M;W;6;0
Judge;So, Mr. Armstrong? Where does this leave us?;1;M;W;3;0
Will;Well, we can officially rule out that Cynthia couldn't have shot the victim.;2;L;W;4;0
Will;However, we have to determine what caused the heart failure.;4;L;W;4;0
Will;And if old age isn't the culprit...;4;L;W;4;0
Will;Then there would have to be some sort of chemical to induce the heart failure.;1;L;W;4;0
Will;Aka, a poison...;7;L;W;4;0
Richards;Objection!;0;R;W;5;0
Richards;Y-You may have proven there were no shots fired, greenhorn...;3;R;W;5;0

Will;Don't let you're pride lead you to conclusions, Richards!;7;L;W;4;0
Will;I can prove just how Mr. Sullivan was poisoned.;1;L;W;4;0

Will;It's extremely important, your Honor. Please grant me this request.;1;L;W;4;0

Judge;"...Avoid caffeine to prevent complications...";0;M;R;3;0

Judge;And?;1;M;W;3;0
Will;Remember that bullet in the victim's chest... the bullet that was proven to be there before the murder.;4;L;W;4;0
